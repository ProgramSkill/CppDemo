# 8051 Peripherals

## Overview

The 8051 microcontroller includes several built-in peripherals:

1. **Timers/Counters** - Two 16-bit timers (Timer 0 and Timer 1)
2. **Interrupts** - 5 interrupt sources (2 external, 3 internal)
3. **Serial Port** - Full-duplex UART for serial communication
4. **I/O Ports** - Four 8-bit bidirectional ports

## Peripheral Documentation

- `Timers.md` - Timer/Counter programming and modes
- `Interrupts.md` - Interrupt system and handling
- `Serial_Communication.md` - UART serial communication
- `GPIO.md` - General Purpose I/O operations

## Common Use Cases

- **Timers**: Delays, PWM generation, event counting
- **Interrupts**: External events, timer overflows, serial communication
- **Serial Port**: Communication with PC, other microcontrollers, sensors
- **GPIO**: LED control, button input, sensor interfacing

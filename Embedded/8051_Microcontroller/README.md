# 8051 Microcontroller Development Guide

## Overview

The 8051 microcontroller (also known as MCS-51) is one of the most popular and widely used microcontroller families in embedded systems. Originally developed by Intel in 1980, it has become an industry standard with numerous variants from different manufacturers.

## Key Features

- **8-bit CPU**: Optimized for control applications
- **Harvard Architecture**: Separate program and data memory
- **128 bytes RAM**: Internal data memory
- **4KB ROM/EPROM**: Program memory (expandable to 64KB)
- **32 I/O lines**: Organized as four 8-bit ports (P0, P1, P2, P3)
- **Two 16-bit timers/counters**: Timer 0 and Timer 1
- **Full-duplex UART**: Serial communication
- **5 interrupt sources**: 2 external, 3 internal
- **Boolean processor**: Bit-addressable operations
